Schwab Streamer API
The Streamer API enables clients to connect into different services to stream market data and account activity with JSON-formatting via WebSockets. Authentication and entitlements are provided via the Access token generated from the POST Token endpoint. Streamer information to establish the connection can be found on the GET User Preference endpoint. Client as referenced throughout this document is in reference to the application.

2. Request Format
A client request will consist of an array of one or more commands. Each command will include:

Request	Name	Parameter
service	Service Name (required)	ADMIN, LEVELONE_EQUITY etc. Please see Service Names table above.
command	Command (required)	LOGIN, SUBS, ADD, UNSUBS, VIEW, LOGOUT
requestid	Request ID (required)	Unique number that will identify this request.
SchwabClientCustomerId	Client's customer ID	`schwabClientCustomerId` as found in GET User Preference endpoint
SchwabClientCorrelId	Client's session ID	`schwabClientCorrelId` as found in GET User Preference endpoint. Unique identifier value that is attached to requests and messages that allow reference to a particular transaction or event chain.
parameters	Any parameter (optional)	fields, version, credential, symbol, frequency, period, etc
Command	Name
LOGIN	Initial request when opening a new connection. This must be successful before sending other commands.
SUBS	
Subscribes to a set of symbols or keys for a particular service. This overwrites all previously subscribed symbols for that service. This is a convenient way to wipe out old subscription list and start fresh, but it's not the most efficient. If you only want to add one symbol to 300 already subscribed, use an ADD instead.
For example:
 

SUBS A,B,C (fresh sub for LEVELONE_EQUITIES)
SUBS A (fresh sub for LEVELONE_EQUITIES, previous SUBS of B,C are unsub'ed, only A is sub'ed)
ADD	
Adds a new symbol for a particular service. This does NOT wipe out previous symbols that were already subscribed. It is OK to use ADD for first subscription command instead of SUBS.
For example:
 

ADD A,B (fresh sub for LEVELONE_EQUITIES)
ADD C (additional symbol C added to A, B. All 3 symbols will stream)
UNSUBS	This unsubscribes a symbol to a list of subscribed symbol for a particular service.
VIEW	This changes the field subscription for a particular service. It will apply to all symbols for that particular service.
LOGOUT	Logs out of the streamer connection. Streamer will close the connection.

4. Response Codes
 

Code	Name	Description	Connection Severed	Error Notes
0	SUCCESS	The request was successful	No	n/a - success
3	LOGIN_DENIED	The user login has been denied	Yes	Client should reconnect and re-login with new token. Client to determine if failed logins are expected.
9	UNKNOWN_FAILURE	Error of last-resort when no specific error was caught	TBD	Should be investigated by Trader API team. Please contact TraderAPI@Schwab.com if you see this with the `schwabClientCorrelId` of subscription.
11	SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE	The service is not available	No	Should be investigated by Trader API team. Please contact TraderAPI@Schwab.com if you see this with the `schwabClientCorrelId` of subscription. Either client is requesting an unsupported service or the service is not running from the source.
12	CLOSE_CONNECTION	You've reached the maximum number of connections allowed.	Yes	Client to determine if max connections are expected and proper response to customer. A limit of 1 Streamer connection at any given time from a given user is available.
19	REACHED_SYMBOL_LIMIT	Subscribe or Add command has reached a total subscription symbol limit	No	Client to determine if symbol limit is expected and proper response to customer.
20	STREAM_CONN_NOT_FOUND	No connection found for user or new session but no login request	TBD	
Server cannot find the connection based on the provided SchwabClientCustomerId & SchwabClientCorrelId in the request.Should be investigated by Trader API team. Please contact TraderAPI@Schwab.com if you see this with the `schwabClientCorrelId` of subscription.
Common causes:
 

Client does not wait for a successful LOGIN response and issues a command immediately after the LOGIN command. There could be a race condition where the SUB is processed before the LOGIN.
Client modifies SchwabClientCustomerId or SchwabClientCorrelId after logging in.
Streamer has disconnected the client while processing the command.
21	BAD_COMMAND_FORMAT	Command fails to match specification	No	Client should investigate why a command is not formatted properly
22	FAILED_COMMAND_SUBS	Subscribe command could not be completed successfully	No	
Should be investigated by Trader API team. Please contact TraderAPI@Schwab.com if you see this with the `schwabClientCorrelId` of subscription.

Response Field Definitions
Outside of fields that can be subscribed to, Streamer also returns initial data that indicates whether the data is real time or NFL (delayed).

Field Name	Type	Field Description	Notes, Examples Source
key	String	Usually this is the symbol	AAPL
delayed	boolean	Whether data is from the SIP or NFL	- false : data is from a SIP 
SIP stands for Securities Information Processor. Often considered the example for market data around the world, a SIP will collect trade and quote data from multiple exchanges and consolidate these sources into a single source of information.
- true : data is from an NFL source 
NFL stands for Non-Fee Liable. This either means the result is returning delayed data (typically options, futures and futures options) or the result is returning real-time data from a subset of exchanges and therefore does not contain all markets in the National Plan (typically equity data). Delayed quotes do not represent the most recent last or bid/ask; real-time quotes from the subset of exchanges may not contain the most recent last or bid/ask.
assetMainType	String	Asset Type	BOND, EQUITY, ETF, EXTENDED, FOREX, FUTURE, FUTURE_OPTION, FUNDAMENTAL, INDEX, INDICATOR, MUTUAL_FUND, OPTION, UNKNOWN
assetSubType	String	Asset sub type	ADR, CEF, COE, ETF, ETN, GDR, OEF, PRF, RGT, UIT, WAR
cusip	String	9 digits CUSIP	CUSIP number for the instrument, such as 594918104

9	Last Size	long	Number of shares traded with last trade	Units are shares
10	High Price	double	Day's high trade price	According to industry standard, only regular session trades set the High and Low
